> ### Guidelines for raising a new issue:
>
> - Each issue should have an appropriate and short title like "Bug in Experience Page"
>
> - Whenever a participant raises an issue, by default it would be assigned to that participant due to obvious reasons. 
>
> - Be specific about your intended changes/suggestions
>
> - Refrain from using phrases like "Hi, I am ..", "Please assign me this issue", "Thank You..", etc. We are only interested in technical parts
>
> - Attach a screenshot/clip if applicable
>
> - Please be patient enough. The project maintainers/mentors would review it as per their schedule. Refrain from putting up comments like "Please check this" ,"Please review this PR" etc.
>
>-  An issue would be assigned to a participant for a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 3 days. If the tenure of a particular participant is not over please do not spam the issue thread by writing, " I am interested" etc. You are welcome to do so if the participant has not met the requirements with around 12 hours remaining for their deadline.
>
> - Feel free to suggest your opinions on the already raised issues.
>
> - All participants are welcomed to suggest new features/bug fixes/improvements and raise new issues for those. However, the assignment would be done once approved by either of the project maintainers or the mentors.
>
> - Do not blindly comment on issues raised by other participant(s). Unless a minimum of 48 hours has passed since their assignment, the issue would not be re-assigned(excluding certain cases). The issue raised by a participant will always to be assigned to him/her by default. Do not spam "Interested", "Please assign me" in others issues.
>
> - Always keep a note of the deadline.

##  B. Contributing to the Project

*3.* Track your changes:heavy_check_mark: 


git add . 


*4.* Commit your changes .


git commit -m "Relevant message"  (usually title of the pull request)

- *Make sure to condense your changes into a single commit*.

*5.* Push the committed changes in your feature branch to your remote repo.


git push -u origin <your_branch_name>


*6.* To create a pull request, click on `compare and pull requests`. Please ensure you compare your feature branch to the desired branch of the repo you are suppose to make a PR to.

> ### Guidelines for raising a pull request:
>
> - Each pull request should have an appropriate and short title like "Fixed Bug in Experience Page"
>
> - In case of multiple commits, please perform a rebase and make a squash commit before giving the pull request.
>
> - Pull Requests without a description would often not be reviewed. Make sure you describe your intended changes in the description section of the pull request. (Use bullet points and phrases)
>
> - Make sure to refer the respective issue in the respective PR using phrases like `Resolves #issue_number` or `Closes #issue_number`.  Here's an example to raise a PR:


# Work Done:

- Fixed Responsiveness bug in the MOOC Section of the Education Page
- Made the Favicon more optimized
- ...
- ...
- ...

# Relevant Screenshots/Gifs


> - Refrain from using phrases like "Hi, I am ..", "Please merge this PR", "Thank You..", etc. We are only interested in technical parts.
>
> - Attach a screenshot/clip of the change(s).
>
> - Please be patient enough. The project maintainers/mentors would review it as per their schedule. Please do not start putting comments like "Please check this" etc.
>
> - Not every PR would be merged directly. In majority of the scenarios, we would be offering some additional suggestions which are to be incorporated in the same PR with a squash commit.
>
> - Look out for possible merge conflicts. Please add comments required, this makes your code readable.
>
>- Make sensible variable names. For example, card1 is quite ambiguous but education_card implies what that variable is declared for.
>
> - Although we support feedback from everyone in all phases of development, it is highly advised not to put any negative comments in other participant's pull requests.
>
> - Always keep a note of the deadline.


*9.* Voila :exclamation: You have made a PR to the WebDev-Playyard : . Sit back patiently and relax while the project maintainers review your PR. Please understand at times the time can vary from a few hours to a few days.
